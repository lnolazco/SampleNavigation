### Realtime
#### For IOS:
I used this repo
https://github.com/realtime-framework/RealtimeMessaging-ReactNativeIOSExample
but the instructions are not so correct... so, this is what I did:

install dependency:
npm install --save react-native-realtimemessaging-ios

Open xcode (project/ios/SampleNavigation.xcodeproj)
In the folder Libraries select Add files to "Project" and select the dependecy installed located in node_modules/react-native-realtimemessaging-ios
Then click on the project folder and go to the tab Build Phases and below Link Binary With Libraries drag/add the file libRCTRealtimeMessaging.a from 'Libraries/SampleNavigation.xcodeproj/Products/libRCTRealtimeMessaging.a'.

Then I added to services the file 'RCTRealtimeMessaging.js' from ./node_modules/react-native-realtimemessaging-ios/RCTRealtimeMessagingIOS.js
